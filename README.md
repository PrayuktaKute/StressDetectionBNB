# Stress Detection Using Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model
This repository contains a machine learning project that detects stress levels using a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model. The project explores the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data and classify stress levels.

# Features
1) Stress Detection Model: Implements Bernoulli Naive Bayes to classify text data into stress or non-stress categories.
2) Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization using binary features.
3) Dataset: Utilizes labeled textual data for stress detection (e.g., social media posts or custom datasets).
4) Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance.
